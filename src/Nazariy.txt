1. Thread lifecycle includes 3 steps(New,In process, finish) or 4 if he had a period of wait. The first period is new when it recently created
and doesn't start his work. The second period is when In process it means thread start his work and working at that time.
The third period is when thread wait anything (it maybe notify from another thread or thread wait a deadline of sleep method).
And the last period is then thread when thread is ended his work.
2.Difference between Callable and Runnable is only that Callable is waiting any value which we have to give for them but
Runnable isn't waiting any value cause Runnable is void. We can say that Callable is older brother of Runnable.
And for using Callable in Thread Pools we can not use 'execute', so we have to use 'submit' and we also can use 'submit'
with Runnable.
